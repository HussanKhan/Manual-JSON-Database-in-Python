# Manual-JSON-Database-in-Python

This is a python program that allows you to create, view, append a JSON file, and allows you to remove entries from a JSON file. 
The JSON database uses the format below to create a JSON file, and is also made to read and append in that format. 

{ ‘FILE_NAME’ : [ {‘KEY’:’VALUE’}, {'KEY2':'VALUE2'} ] }

The user creates key value pairs and has to manually put in information. 

<b>Motivation</b>

This is my third ever program, and I personally thought it would be good practice with JSON. As mentioned before, this program creates a database in python that a user can manually edit. 

<b>Build Status</b>

Currently the program functions as it’s supposed to, so it is completed. I may edit it in the future if I find any errors.

<b>Code Style</b>

The style of my code may seem pretty basic, but this is the third program I have ever made, so I think it’s acceptable. If you think there is a more efficient way to do something, please let me know.   

<b>Installation</b> 

The program stores the JSON database in whatever dictionary the program is run. The program also loads JSON databases that are in proper  format, if it is in the same dictionary as the running program. 

<b>How to Use</b>

I recommend storing the program in a folder, and then simply running it in the command prompt. Follow the directions provided in the program. 

Press: C = create new json database, L = to load/view current json database, R = to remove an entry, A = Append a JSON file, Q = to quit program
